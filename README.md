Autonomous unmanned GPS vehicle built on Arduino

This project was aimed to design a small self-navigated GPS navigated robot. The robot would get GPS coordinates of the final destination by the user wirelessly and navigate itself using an algorithm designed by our team.

The final design of the robot is a tri-wheeled toy car having two wheels at the back which are connected to two low power DC motors and a supporting roller ball having 360 degree freedom of motion.
